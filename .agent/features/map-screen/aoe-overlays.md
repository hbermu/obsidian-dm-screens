# Map Screen — AoE Overlays

> Spell areas of effect (circle, square, cone, line, ring) drawn over the battlemap on the table TV, driven from the DM panel. AoEs are DM-managed layers: added from shape presets or a 5e spell catalog, positioned and rotated by dragging in the pan preview, and rendered at true grid scale (1 square = 5 ft) on both the preview and the TV.

## Source files

- `src/map/types.ts` — `AoeShape`, `MapAoe` (incl. optional `label`), `AoePreset`
- `src/map/aoe.ts` — `renderAoe`: pure canvas renderer shared by the TV and the DM preview
- `src/map/spellAoes.ts` — `SPELL_AOES`: generated catalog of 5e spells with a parseable area of effect
- `src/map/map.ts` — `map-aoe-sync` handler; renders the list in `applyLayout()`
- `src/views/SpellAoeModal.ts` — fuzzy-search modal over `SPELL_AOES`
- `src/views/MapScreenPanel.ts` — AoE Overlays section (menu, rows), preview markers (dot + rotation handle), `broadcastAoes` throttle, lifecycle resets

## Settings used

none — AoEs live in DM-panel memory and the server's late-joiner cache, never in settings.

## Requirements

1. Each AoE shall carry `{ id, shape, sizeFt, widthFt, color, opacity, rotation, x, y, label? }`, with `x`/`y` in map pixels and sizes in feet converted at `pxPerSquare / 5` px per foot. `widthFt` is the line's width and the ring's band thickness; it is ignored by circle/square/cone.
2. The Add AoE menu shall offer the five base shapes (Circle, Square, Cone, Line, Ring from `SHAPE_PRESETS`) plus a Spells… entry that opens the `SpellAoeModal`; picking a spell shall add an AoE with the spell's shape, size, and color, labeled with the spell name (shown in its row and dot tooltip). New AoEs spawn at the map center with rotation 0.
3. `SPELL_AOES` shall contain every 5etools spell whose area of effect is parseable from its structured range or entry text, colored by primary damage type; the file is generated, sorted by name, and deduplicated by name across sources. A few spells whose area cannot be auto-parsed (e.g. Wall of Fire's line and ring forms) are hand-added in the same alphabetical order.
4. Each AoE row shall expose: shape select, size (ft), width (ft, line and ring only — labeled width for lines and band thickness for rings), color, opacity slider, rotation (degrees), and delete; the section header carries Add AoE and, when any AoE exists, Clear All.
5. The map client shall render each AoE on the grid canvas as a filled+stroked path — circle of `sizeFt` radius, square of `sizeFt` side centered, cone from the vertex spanning 53°, line of `sizeFt` × `widthFt` from the anchor, ring of `sizeFt` outer radius with a hole of `sizeFt − widthFt` (clamped to ≥ 0) so the band grows inward from the outer edge — filled at the AoE's opacity and stroked at full alpha in its color.
6. `renderAoe` shall place the shape at `T + s·R(θ)·p` (the stage transform) and rotate it by `aoe.rotation + θ`, so AoEs stay attached to the map under every 90° view rotation.
7. In the DM pan preview (both scale modes), the real AoE footprints shall be drawn on an overlay canvas at preview scale; each AoE carries a draggable anchor dot (move) and, for shapes that are not rotationally symmetric (i.e. not circle or ring), a diamond rotation handle at the shape's tip (cone/line) or mid-edge (square) that rotates in 5° steps. Both markers counter-scale with the preview zoom. The AoE section is rendered by the reusable `renderAoeSection(container, map, onChange)`; the Exploration modal renders both the same draggable dots/handles over its own stage (`fog-of-war.md` requirement 52) and the full AoE controls in its sidebar (`fog-of-war.md` requirement 43a), so AoEs can be moved, rotated, added, edited, and removed during table play.
8. Drag moves, handle rotations, and opacity slides shall broadcast `map-aoe-sync` throttled to 80 ms with an immediate broadcast on release; structural edits (add, delete, clear, shape/size/width/color/rotation-field changes) broadcast immediately. Size/width/opacity edits redraw the preview canvas in place.
9. When a map is applied, the DM panel shall reset the AoE list and broadcast the empty `map-aoe-sync` (overwriting any cached list); when Stop Map is clicked or `map-clear` arrives, both DM and map sides shall reset to empty.
10. `republishToServer()` shall re-broadcast `map-aoe-sync` when the list is non-empty, and the DM panel shall restore its AoE list from the cached `map-aoe-sync` on open, so both a restarted server and a reopened panel converge on the same state.

## Broadcast / IPC

| Message type | Direction | Payload | When |
|--------------|-----------|---------|------|
| `map-aoe-sync` | DM → map | `{ aoes: MapAoe[] }` | Any AoE change (drags throttled per requirement 8); empty list on map apply; `republishToServer()` when non-empty |

## Tests covering this

- `src/__tests__/map-aoe-render.test.ts` — shape paths (incl. ring outer/reversed-inner arcs and inner-radius clamp), ft→px sizing, rotation-composed placement, fill/stroke styling
- `src/__tests__/map-screen-panel-aoe.test.ts` — restore from cache, stopMap reset, republish inclusion, broadcast throttle with forced flush
- `test/e2e/specs/aoe-vision.e2e.ts` — real Obsidian: Add AoE > Circle syncs and renders row + anchor dot, dragging the dot moves and broadcasts, remove empties the sync
- `test/e2e/specs/aoe-shapes.e2e.ts` — real Obsidian: Cone/Line/Ring add with their per-shape fields (line width, ring band thickness) and rotation-handle presence (cone/line rotatable, ring symmetric); dragging the `.dm-map-aoe-rot-handle` rotates and broadcasts; Clear All empties the sync; Add AoE > Spells… picks from the catalog and adds a labeled `cone` AoE (Burning Hands, 15 ft)

## Non-goals

- Snapping AoEs to the grid. Free placement is the point — templates sit where the spell lands.
- Persisting AoEs per map in `mapConfigs`. They are ephemeral combat state; the late-joiner cache covers reconnects.
- AoEs on the player screen at `/`. Map channel only.
- Regenerating `SPELL_AOES` at runtime or shipping the 5etools data. The catalog is a committed, generated file.
