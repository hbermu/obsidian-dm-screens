# WebSocket Protocol

> Exhaustive message catalogue for the DM ↔ player WebSocket. Every message is a JSON object `{ type: string, payload: object }`. Connections are tagged with a **channel** (`player` for the `/` page, `map` for the `/map` page); message types prefixed `map-` belong to the `map` channel and every other type to the `player` channel — broadcast, cache replay, and cache purge are all channel-scoped. Adding a new message type means adding a row to the table below and a handler on both sides.

## Source files

- `src/server.ts` — `broadcast()`, late-joiner cache, message parsing (`PlayerMessage` interface)
- `src/main.ts` — `sendInitiativeUpdate()` (the only broadcast call outside `DmControlPanel` and `HydrusExplorerModal`)
- `src/views/DmControlPanel.ts` — emits `image-layers-sync`, `combat-scale`, `viewport-update`, `show-background-media`, `hide-background-media`, `clear`
- `src/views/HydrusExplorerModal.ts` — emits `show-background-media` for files chosen from the Hydrus library
- `src/player/player.ts` — handles every DM → player message, emits `client-info`

## Settings used

- `lastBroadcastCache` — persisted serialised messages so that a restart of Obsidian preserves the late-joiner cache

## Requirements

1. The protocol shall transport JSON-encoded objects of the form `{ type: string, payload: object }`.
1b. When a WebSocket connection is established, the server shall tag it with channel `map` if the upgrade request path starts with `/map`, else `player` (`messageChannel(type)` maps a message type to its channel: `map-` prefix → `map`, everything else → `player`).
2. The server shall send a serialised broadcast message exactly once per connected client of the message's channel whose `readyState` is `1` (OPEN); clients of the other channel shall not receive it.
3. When a client connects, the server shall replay every cached message of the client's channel in insertion order before any new broadcast can be sent to that client.
4. When a `clear` broadcast is sent, the server shall purge only the `player`-channel entries from the late-joiner cache before transmitting `clear` to player clients; `map-*` entries survive. Symmetrically, `map-clear` shall purge only the `map-*` entries except `map-calibration` and transmit to map clients only.
4b. When a `hide-background-media` broadcast is sent, the server shall delete the `show-background-media` cache entry and shall not cache the `hide-background-media` message itself.
5. When any broadcast other than `clear`/`map-clear`/`hide-background-media` is sent, the server shall overwrite the cache entry for `message.type` with the new serialised payload (one entry per type at most).
5b. Every `image-layers-sync` broadcast shall be followed immediately by an `image-layers-geometry` broadcast derived from the same state, so the cached geometry entry is never staler than the cached sync (cache replay preserves first-insertion order: sync before geometry).
6. When the player side receives a message whose `type` is not in its known set, it shall log `[Player Screen] Unknown message type:` and ignore the payload (no throw, no disconnect).
7. When the player side fails to parse a message as JSON, it shall log the failure and ignore the message.
8. When the WebSocket closes on the player side after the player has connected at least once, the player shall display a full-screen `Disconnected` overlay and attempt to reconnect after 3 seconds. On a successful reconnect that follows a previous disconnect, the player shall reload the page so the server's late-joiner cache replay reconstructs the screen from scratch. On the very first successful connect (no prior disconnect), the player shall hide the overlay if present and send `client-info`.
9. Player-side and map-side code shall not assign a payload URL field (`show-background-media.payload.url`, `map-show.payload.url`, `image-layers-sync.payload.layers[].dataUrl`, `image-layers-sync.payload.layers[].fogDataUrl`, `map-fog.payload.dataUrl`) to a DOM URL sink without first validating it with `safePlayerUrl(url, kind)` from `src/player/safeUrl.ts`. The helper accepts only `/vault/...` paths and `data:image/...` / `data:video/...` URLs of an allowlisted MIME family (no `image/svg+xml`, no `text/*`, no absolute HTTP URLs, no `javascript:`). Rejected URLs shall be logged via `console.warn` and the affected element (layer image, fog overlay, background) shall be skipped — no throw, no disconnect.
10. On a WebSocket handshake the server shall require a valid access token (`k` query parameter or `dmScreenKey` cookie) and shall close the socket with code `1008` when it is absent or wrong, before the client is added to any map.
11. When a handshake carries an `Origin` header whose host differs from the request `Host`, the server shall close the socket with code `1008`. WebSockets are exempt from CORS, so a page on any LAN origin could otherwise open a socket from inside a player's browser. A handshake with **no** `Origin` header — non-browser clients, including the e2e `WsRecorder` — shall be accepted when the token is valid.
12. The `WebSocketServer` shall be constructed with `maxPayload: 65536`; a larger frame is rejected by `ws` before it reaches the plugin.
13. When a client sends more than 20 messages in any rolling one-second window, the server shall close it with code `1008` and stop processing that frame.
14. Channel selection shall be computed from the handshake path with the query string stripped, so `/map?k=…` still resolves to the `map` channel.
15. Both browser bundles shall read the token from `?k=` first and fall back to the `dmScreenKey` cookie, and shall append it to their WebSocket URL (`/?k=…` for the player, `/map?k=…` for the map).
16. Every payload field a bundle treats as a number shall be coerced with `finiteOr(value, default)` before it reaches a CSS transform, a canvas call, or stored state. A `NaN` or `Infinity` in a transform blanks the screen with nothing in the console, so the default wins silently instead. This covers the player's `panX`/`panY`/`zoom` and the map's `map-view` pan and `map-config` `pxPerSquare`/`gridOffsetX`/`gridOffsetY`/`gridOpacity` (opacity additionally clamped to 0–1).
17. `map-view.mode` shall be accepted only as `fit` or `physical` and `map-view.rotation` only as 0, 90, 180 or 270; any other value falls back to `fit` and 0 respectively.
18. Every payload array shall pass `boundedArray`, which returns `[]` for a non-array and truncates to 200 entries with a `console.warn`. This covers the player's `combatants` and both layer arrays and the map's `aoes`, `visions` and `walls`.
19. When the late-joiner cache exceeds 2 MiB in total, the server shall evict its largest entry repeatedly until it fits, never dropping the last remaining entry. The cache is persisted as `settings.lastBroadcastCache`, so the budget bounds `data.json` as well as the heap.
20. The server shall expose an `onStateChange(callback): () => void` method that subscribes to state mutations. The callback shall fire after any `lastState` mutation, including cache purges (`clear`, `map-clear`, `hide-background-media`), cache updates and replay-cache evictions. The returned unsubscribe function shall remove the callback.

## Tests covering this

- `src/__tests__/server-broadcast.test.ts` — late-joiner replay; `readyState` filtering; `clear` cache purge
- `src/__tests__/server-map-channel.test.ts` — channel tagging, channel-filtered broadcast/replay, channel-scoped `clear`/`map-clear` purges
- `src/__tests__/server-combat-scale.test.ts` — `combat-scale` round-trip
- `src/__tests__/server-bootstrap.integration.test.ts` — real `ws` client receives the cached state on connect
- `src/__tests__/ddb-to-player.integration.test.ts` — D&D Beyond poll cycle → `initiative-update` on the wire
- `src/__tests__/ddb-fixture-replay.integration.test.ts` — recorded D&D Beyond fixture replays through the server and produces `initiative-update` messages
- `test/e2e/specs/server.e2e.ts` — real Obsidian: per-channel late-joiner replay (`waiting-screen`/`inspiration-style` on player, `map-calibration` on map, no cross-channel leaks) over a real WebSocket

## Non-goals

- Binary frames. All traffic is JSON text.
- Server → player message acknowledgements. Broadcasts are fire-and-forget.
- Ordering guarantees across types. Different types are independent; a `combat-scale` may arrive before an `image-layers-sync` even if the DM emitted them in the other order under heavy load.
- Backwards-compatible aliasing of removed message types. When a type is removed, the handler is removed from `player.ts` in the same commit.
